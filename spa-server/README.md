# Auth0 API

This is a sample project created from the Auth0 official tutorial for creating APIs https://auth0.com/docs/api

Before going to the [SPA Guide](/docs/SPA_GUIDE.md), you need to setup your local environment first. We will assume you have started a NodeJS based RESTfull service. Since I am a react+nodejs developer, my samnple is in NestJS.
